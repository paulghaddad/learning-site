        <p>If you’re learning a new topic, you owe it to yourself to have an efficient and effective learning process.
          Thankfully, you can teach yourself how to learn without investing a lot of time or wasting a lot of energy
          identifying what learning tactics work and which ones don’t.</p>

        <p>You don’t need another article that summarizes recent research. You do need a practical guide that simplifies
          the
          learning process. You want answers to these questions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What learning tactics should I use, and how do I apply them?</li>
          <li>How do I retain everything I’ve learned?</li>
          <li>Where can I learn more about the learning process?</li>
        </ul>

        This guide is our attempt to answer these questions.

        <p>Choose a learning tactic below and apply it to the topic you’re learning about. There are many tactics
          offered—for
          both learning and retaining information—to accommodate a variety of learning styles.</p>

        <p>Try a few and find the ones that work for you. Then, revisit this list as you learn new topics. The tactics
          you
          need may vary by the topic you’re learning.</p>

        <h2>Learn It</h2>

        <h3>1. Get the Big Picture</h3>

        <p>You want to put together a 1,000-word puzzle. But, before you begin, you prop up the puzzle box on the table
          and
          take a good look at it, since it contains an image of what the puzzle looks like when complete. You mentally
          note
          its major features: a bridge, several skyscrapers, a river, and a sky at sunset.</p>

        <p>You’ve just made solving the puzzle easier because you have the big picture: a high-level view of your task
          and
          what to focus on. Instead of dealing with 1,000 random pieces, your mind is primed to think about the major
          components that you’ll have to put together.</p>

        <p>When you get the big picture, you move from disorder to order; complex to simple; difficult to manageable. As
          a
          result, you’ll work with purpose because you know what to focus on.</p>

        <p>Learning a new topic is no different.</p>

        <p>Typically, when learning a new topic people dive into the details—all of the details—from the start. They
          sink a
          ton of time and effort learning everything only to realize after the fact that they only needed a fraction of
          what
          they learned.</p>

        <p>Enter the big picture. It’s when you get a general understanding of a topic—a lay of the land—by identifying
          core
          concepts before you try to learn the material. In the process, you identify what topics matter most and where
          you
          ought to focus your time and attention. It’s a simple way to make learning something new much more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>It’s not to say that the details don’t matter. They do. But—and this is the key point—you don’t need to know
          everything right now. Getting the big picture is like a filter: it’ll help you distinguish the nice to know
          from the
          have to know.</p>

        <p>Here are some ways you can get the big picture:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Watch a lecture on fast speed. Undoubtedly, you’ll miss most of the details. That’s fine, because your aim
            is to
            identify the core concepts discussed. Then, decide whether or not they’re relevant to the overall subject
            that
            you’re trying to learn. Oftentimes, an instructor will spend a lot of time discussing important concepts or
            they’ll repeat important concepts multiple times. These may be components to add to the big picture of
            whatever
            you’re learning about.</li>
          <li>Skim chapter headers. The headings of a chapter or article often give away a lot of information. If you
            find a
            relevant header, skim the passage under that header.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone who already knows the material. Identify one to three people who’ve already learned the
            material
            you’re trying to learn. Contact them, and ask if they’d be willing to talk to you about their learning
            journey.
            Ask which concepts they focused on; how they determined their learning sequence; and what they’d do
            differently if
            they were to start over again. You’ll start to see patterns after you talk to a few people. Use this
            information
            to inform your own learning journey.</li>
          <li>Read the chapter summary. The end of a book chapter often contains a section that summarizes key points.
            Read
            this first to understand the main ideas that are discussed. If an idea seems important, then skim the
            relevant
            section.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Getting the big picture will help you train your brain to hone in on the topics that matter most, and filter
          out
          the lesser ones. It'll also help you focus on the right things at the right time, while realizing that you can
          always circle back in the future to some nuance when you need it.</p>
