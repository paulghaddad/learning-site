        <p class="text-xl text-zinc-800">How to Learn Effectively</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If you’re learning a new topic, you owe it to yourself to have an efficient and effective learning process.
          Thankfully, you can teach yourself how to learn without investing a lot of time or wasting a lot of energy
          identifying what learning tactics work and which ones don’t.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You don’t need another article that summarizes recent research. You <em>do</em> need a practical guide that simplifies
          the learning process.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You want answers to these questions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="text-zinc-800">What topics should I learn first?</li>
          <li class="text-zinc-800">What learning tactics should I use, and how do I apply them?</li>
          <li class="text-zinc-800">How do I retain everything I’ve learned, so I don’t forget it all?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="border-solid border-b border-gray-900 pb-3 text-zinc-800">This guide is our attempt to answer these questions.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Principles of Learning is a three-part framework:</p>

        <p><a href="#understand-the-terrain" class="text-lg text-zinc-900 hover:text-red-700">1. Understand the Terrain</a></p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Get a general scope of a topic <em>before</em> you set out to learn it. Doing
        so will make your learning process efficient because you know
        <em>what</em> to focus on.</p>

        <p><a href="#learn-it" class="text-lg text-zinc-900 hover:text-red-700">2. Learn It</a></p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Once you know <em>what</em> topics you need to learn, then you can focus on
        learning them effectively. There are many tactics offered—for both
        learning and retaining information—to accommodate a variety of learning
        styles.</p>

        <p><a href="#retain-it" class="text-lg text-zinc-900 hover:text-red-700">3. Retain It</a></p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Be ready, not rusty, when the day comes to recall previously learned
        material.</p>

        <p class="border-solid border-b border-gray-900 pb-3 text-zinc-800">Try a few of the tactics in our framework, and find the ones that
        work for you. Then, revisit this list as you learn new topics. The
        tactics you need may vary by the topic you’re learning.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You’re going to put together a 1,000-piece puzzle. But, before you
        begin, you take a long look at the box, since it contains an image of
        what the puzzle looks like when complete. You mentally note its major
        features: a bridge, several skyscrapers, a river, and a sky at
        sunset.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You’ve just made solving the puzzle easier because you get the big
        picture: you have a high-level view of your task and what to focus on.
        Instead of dealing with 1,000 random pieces, your mind is primed to
        think about the major components that you’ll have to put together. </p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400
        text-center"><em>Talent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're
          willing to practice, you can do.</em><br>-Bob Ross</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">When you get the big picture, you move from disorder to order;
        complex to simple; difficult to manageable. As a result, you’ll work
        with purpose because you know what to focus on.</p>

        <figure class="float-right ml-4 pl-4">

          <figcaption class="text-center"><em>Mastery</em><br>-Robert Greene</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">And that’s why getting the big picture is essential when it comes to
        learning something new. Unfortunately, most people neglect this
        step.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Typically, when learning a new topic people dive into the details—all
        of the details—from the start. They sink a ton of time and effort
        learning <em>everything</em> only to realize after the fact that they only needed
        a fraction of what they learned.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Enter getting the big picture. It’s when you get a general
        understanding of a topic—a lay of the land—by identifying core concepts
        you need to learn <em>before</em> you try to learn the material. In the process,
        you identify what topics matter most and where you ought to focus your
        time and attention. It’s a simple way to make learning something new
        much more efficient.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">It’s not to say that the details don’t matter. They do. But—and this
        is the key point—you don’t need to know everything right <em>now</em>. Getting
        the big picture is like a filter: it’ll help you distinguish between the
        nice to know from the have to know.<p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Here are some ways to get the big picture.</p>

        <ul class="text-zinc-800">
          <li><strong>Talk to someone who already knows the
              material. </strong>Identify one to three people who’ve already
            learned the material you’re trying to learn. Contact them, and ask
            if they’d be willing to talk to you about their learning journey.
            Ask which concepts they focused on; how they determined their
            learning sequence; and what they’d do differently if they were to
            start over again. You’ll start to see patterns after you talk to a
            few people. Use this information to inform your own learning
            journey.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch a lecture on fast speed.</strong> Undoubtedly,
            you’ll miss most of the details. That’s fine, because your aim is to
            identify the core concepts discussed. Then, decide whether or not
            they’re relevant to the overall subject that you’re trying to learn.
            Oftentimes, an instructor will spend a lot of time discussing
            important concepts or they’ll repeat important concepts multiple
            times. These may be components to add to the big picture of whatever
            you’re learning about.</li>
          <li><strong>Skim chapter headers.</strong> The headings of a chapter or article often
            give away a lot of information. If you find a relevant header, skim
            the passage under that header.</li>
          <li><strong>Read the chapter summary.</strong> The end of a book chapter often contains
            a section that summarizes key points. Read this first to understand
            the main ideas that are discussed. If an idea seems important, then
            skim the relevant section.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Think of the 80/20 rule when you get the big picture. This rule
        states that roughly 80% of the results come from 20% of the efforts. So,
        for our purposes, identify the topics that’ll give you the biggest
        return for your time and effort.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Getting the big picture will help you train your brain to hone in on
        the topics that matter most, and filter out the lesser ones. It'll also
        help you focus on the right things at the right time, while realizing
        that you can always circle back in the future to some nuance when you
        need it.</p>

        <h2 class="text-red-700 text-4xl" id="learn-it">Learn It</h2>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="cross-train">1. Cross-Train</h3>


        <p class="text-zinc-800">Many athletes cross-train by regularly incorporating a related skill or task into their workout routine. A swimmer completes a run or two each week; a runner completes one or more bike workouts each week.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">By cross-training, athletes push their cardiovascular fitness in a different way. This adds to their overall fitness. It also keeps things fresh and prevents burnout. In short, cross-training complements the skill you’re building.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">And it’s not just for athletes.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Cross-training is useful for intellectual pursuits as well. Cross-train your brain to improve your mental fitness by regularly incorporating a related skill or task in your learning routine.</p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400
                  text-center"><em>Winners don't do different things, they do things
                    differently.</em><br>-Shiv Khera</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The cross-training methods you incorporate vary from field to field. A programmer, for example, can cross-train by
        solving math problems or working through a logic course. These are useful activities because both involve logical
        thinking, and so does programming. By cross-training, a programmer gets practice thinking logically in a different
        context. That’s a key point.</p>


        <p class="text-zinc-800">Changing contexts forces you to think differently, use a variety of tactics, and see things from another perspective. It also forces you outside of your comfort zone, which is where you’ll learn and grow the most.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Once you identify a cross-training method, apply it at least one time each week. Consistency is critical to reap the best results.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="study-experts">2. Study Experts</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">“First you imitate, then you innovate,” Miles Davis once said. Athletes, musicians, writers, and artists, among many others, have put this idea into action—and for good reason. It works.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If you’re trying to learn a new skill, then you ought to give it a try. Do so by studying the work of others using a learning tactic Benjamin Franklin applied to become a better writer. Below is a summary of Franklin’s process, as explained in his autobiography.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Franklin would choose an article from <em>The Spectator</em>—a publication he
        admired and wanted to emulate—and study it by making hints of the
        “sentiment” in each sentence. After a few days passed, Franklin used the
        hints to replicate the article. </p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400
                   text-center"><em>Some people want it to happen, some wish it
                     would happen, others make it happen.</em><br>-Michael Jordan</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This wasn’t a process in memorization; he wasn’t trying to memorize the article word for word. Rather, he aimed to capture the same expression and completeness as the original—using his own words.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Franklin concluded the process by comparing his version of the article to the one he studied: he identified his mistakes and corrected them.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This tactic can be molded to fit nearly any skill you’re working on.
        The recipe is nearly the same.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-800">Step 1. Find someone in your field who does the thing you want to do and does it well.</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This should be someone whose skills you admire and want to emulate.
        Ideally, this is someone who’s better than you. Think of the experts in
        your field for ideas.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Even someone who’s a step or two ahead of your current skill level
        can work for this practice. For example, a high school basketball player
        may think of an advanced high school or college player.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-800">Step 2. Study this person’s skill—their outcome or performance—by making hints.</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Perhaps, like Franklin, you want to become a better writer. You’ve
        identified a publication you admire and want to emulate; from this
        publication, you’ve selected an article to study. Now you’re going to
        study the article by making hints by capturing the overall ideas and
        expression in each sentence.</p>

        <figure class="float-right ml-4 pl-4">
          <img class="mb-2" src="./images/how_champions_think.png" alt="How
                      Champions Think" width="150" height="230">
          <figcaption class="text-center"><em>How Champions Think</em><br>-Dr. Bob Rotella</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You can easily apply this hint-making process to any other skill,
        from programming to shooting free throws. Take the finished outcome or
        performance—a solution to a problem or completed meal—and work
        backwards. Explain what the person did each step of the way to get to
        this final outcome. Go beyond surface level and fully understand what’s
        happening and why.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Explaining is different than describing.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">To describe Claude Monet’s painting, <em>Arrival of the Normandy Train,
          Gare Saint-Lazare</em>, you may say a train billows smoke as it enters a
        train station. By contrast, if you explain this painting, you would go
        beyond surface level and speculate why Monet painted a train;
        <em>why</em> did he
        use quick brushstrokes of paint?; <em>why</em> did he include the glass-and-iron
        train shed?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">When you explain a concept, you’ll find that the learning process is
        far more meaningful. Plus, this is a great way to test your knowledge.
        If you can’t wrap a simple explanation around a concept or step, then
        that’s a sign you have some learning to do. Pause and learn it.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">It’s better to find out about a trouble spot now—and do something
        about it—than to let it fester. It’s likely that you’ll run into the
        same concept or a related one in a few weeks or months. In short, your
        future self will appreciate the time you spend now learning what’s new
        or unfamiliar to you.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-800">Step 3. Replicate.</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Let some time pass, as Franklin did, then use the hints you created
        as a guide and replicate the skill that you studied. For example,
        re-write the article or re-solve the problem.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The key to this step is to let enough time pass so you forget the
        details that you studied. You’re not trying to memorize; you’re trying
        to learn. Let a few days pass before you replicate the skill that you
        studied. That way, you’re forced to muscle through the process on your
        own.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This step sounds easy. After all, you’ve got your hints. But in
        practice it can be hard to do, even with the hints. So you may not
        re-solve the problem or re-write the article perfectly, if at all.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Don’t get frustrated. Instead, take it as a sign that you’re learning
        and that you chose a good person to study from in step 1. Then, review
        the work you studied, update your hints, and try replicating the work
        once again.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-800">Step 4. Study your outcome.</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Compare your outcome—the thing you just replicated—to the one you studied. As you compare, identify your mistakes and make the changes.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Don’t bypass this step.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">It’s an important one to take in order to build a critical skill: self-assessment. Train your mind and eye to identify your mistakes and correct them.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Apply this learning tactic as often as possible, especially if you’re just starting out. It’s time well-spent. That’s because you’ll hit several core competencies of skill-building:</p>

        <ul class="text-zinc-800">
          <li>Understand the details and nuances of how an expert in your field works.</li>
          <li>Practice doing the thing you want to improve—at the level you aim to be at.</li>
          <li>Get practice teaching yourself.</li>
          <li>Develop your ability to self-assess your own work.</li>
          <li>Build good habits from the start.</li>
          <li>See patterns in your craft.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="teach-it">3. Teach It</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">“If you want to master something,” Yogi Bhajan once said, “teach it.” Whether you aim to master a topic or want to get better at it, then you ought to heed Bhajan’s advice. Fortunately, there are simple ways to go about it.</p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400
                   text-center"><em>The separation of talent and skill is one of
                     the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to
                     excel, who have dreams, who want to do things. Talent you have
                     naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of
                     beating on your craft.</em><br>-Will Smith</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Help Yourself as You Help Others</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">First, teach others. Sure, you could teach a class or author a course. But there are less time intensive ways to go about it.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">One way is to give a short speech or presentation at a Meetup group or Toastmasters club. Many of these organizations are virtual, which makes teaching others even more convenient. Or create a few YouTube videos.</p>

            of Expertise</em><br>-Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Writing is another means of teaching to consider. Submit an article or blog post to one of the many publications that take submissions.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">And if you think you don’t have anything to say or write about because you’re new to the field, think again. Whether you've been working on your skill for months or years, you’ve got something to offer and your field could benefit from a range of voices.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Despite the medium, teaching others will force you to solidify your ideas and test your understanding of a topic. Besides, when you set out to help others by teaching, you also help yourself.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Can You Explain It to Yourself?</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Second, teach yourself.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Once you have a concrete outcome—a painting, an article, a crafted piece of wood—walk yourself through the process of how you got there. You can also apply this technique to performance-related skills, like shooting free throws. Record yourself shooting; then, watch yourself and detail the process along the way.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">In either case, explain—don’t describe—what you did and why you did it.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Swirls and strokes of color—black, white, and beige—fill a large
        horizontal canvas. This statement describes Jackson Pollock’s painting,
        <em>Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)</em>. It’s very basic. It’s surface level. It doesn’t tell you a whole lot.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Don’t describe when you teach yourself. Instead, aim to explain.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If you <em>explain</em> this artwork, you would pull back the covers and dig
        into the deeper meaning of this piece. You may explain answers to these
        questions: <em>Why</em> did Pollock use swirls, strokes, and drops of paint?;
        <em>what</em> do they mean or represent?; <em>how</em> did Pollock work to achieve a
        painting like this?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You dig deeper—moving beyond surface level—when you explain. That’s the goal.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Teaching yourself is a great way to test your knowledge, solidify your understanding, find areas of improvement, and clarify your thinking.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="apply-first-study-second">4. Apply First, Study Second</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">One of the best ways to learn—and actually retain your knowledge—is to use an approach we call Apply First, Study Second.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The idea is to <em>actively</em> apply your existing knowledge first. Attempt the problem; attempt the article; attempt the design. Then, turn to passive modes of learning, such as referencing books or watching tutorials, when you get stuck.</p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400 text-center"><em>You don’t learn, then start. You start, then
          learn.</em><br>-Sahil Lavingia</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Say you want to become a better programmer. Instead of watching hours
        of online tutorials, you do something different: you pick a practice
        project and attempt the project yourself <em>first</em>.</p>

        <figure class="float-right ml-4 pl-4">
          <img class="mb-2 mx-auto"

              Learned:<br> John Wooden's Teaching Principles and Practices</em><br>-Swen Nater and Ronald Gallimore</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Then, when you get stuck, turn to passive modes of learning like
        watching a tutorial. But—and this is the important point—instead of cycling through a bunch of tutorials, you’ll focus on the one that’ll help you push through the roadblock. Simply put, you’ll reference the resource with purpose. Once you have the information that you need, it’s back to the project at hand.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Apply First, Study Second stresses the importance of the attempt.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You don’t need to draw the perfect picture or create an award-winning
        design. <em>Attempt</em> the picture; <em>attempt</em> the design. There’s value in the attempt.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Find the Roadblock</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Applying your existing knowledge first draws awareness to the
        roadblock—the thing you don’t know or need to get better at. You’ll
        think to yourself: How do I do <em>X</em>?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Now that you’re aware of the roadblock, you know where to focus your time and attention. Instead of trying to learn everything about cooking, for instance, or re-learning concepts you already know, zone in on the one thing that’s going to get you past your roadblock. That way, you can move along in the cooking process.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Once you have what you need, then apply it. If you get stuck again, follow the same iterative process: determine the roadblock; identify a resource that’ll help you get past it; apply your newfound knowledge.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Go Against the Grain</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This approach runs counter to how most of us got through school. It
        also runs counter to how many popular learning platforms operate.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">That’s because passive modes of learning are often easier to create
        for the masses than active ones. It’s far easier to watch a math wiz
        solve problems than to solve them yourself. </p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">But easier isn’t better when it comes to learning.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">“We’re easily seduced into believing that learning is better when
        it’s easier,” explain the authors of the book <em>Make It Stick: The
          Science of Successful Learning</em>, “but the research shows the opposite: when the mind has to work, learning sticks better.”</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If you’re looking for an efficient and effective way to learn a topic
        or build a skill, you ought to give Apply First, Study Second a try.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="build-mental-models">5. Build Mental Models</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">A mental model is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model">explanation</a> about how something works in the
        world. You use mental models in daily life to help you think, decide,
        and understand the world around you.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">They’re also useful when learning new things.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Organize your learning into mental models: patterns or frameworks that help explain something in the real world.
        Mental models can help make the abstract concrete; and the complex simple, or at least a bit easier to think about.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400
                   text-center"><em>You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing.
                     I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept
                     pushing.</em><br>-René Descartes</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">One of the best ways to build mental models comes from a familiar, but underutilized, learning tactic: get feedback
        from others.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You may be thinking: That’s so obvious!</p>

        <figure class="float-right ml-4 pl-4">
          <img class="mb-2 mx-auto"

            III, and Mark A. McDaniel</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Well, getting feedback may <em>seem</em> obvious. But few people take advantage of this learning opportunity—and it is an
        opportunity. After all, most of us are surrounded by bright people who are often more than willing to help. We just
        need to simply ask for it.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Those who seek feedback usually do so in order to draw awareness to their blindspots. What you may overlook, someone
        else can point out. Admittedly, this <em>is</em> an obvious reason to get feedback.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">But what’s far less talked about are the mental models you can build.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Many times when a person provides feedback they also share their mental models: how they think about a particular
        topic or concept. In doing so, they may draw a diagram to illustrate their thinking; or they may verbally walk you
        through their thought process. Oftentimes, this is all you need to wrap your mind around a challenging topic.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If the person doesn’t proactively share their mental models, then ask: How did you know to think about <em>X</em> in this way?
        This will prompt them to take a step back and clearly articulate their thinking.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Learning something new—especially complex and abstract concepts—can be hard and time-consuming. Lighten your load by
        regularly asking for feedback. Surely, you’ll get feedback in the traditional sense and often a lot more. Just ask.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="focus-on-the-fundamentals">6. Focus on the Fundamentals</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">There’s an essential question to ask when you set out to learn a new
        topic or build a new skill: <em>What</em> to focus on first?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The answer is simple: the fundamentals. They’re the building blocks of whatever you’re learning about. If you bypass
        the fundamentals, you bypass a solid foundation of knowledge.</p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400 text-center"><em>No one is born a great cook, one learns by
          doing.</em><br>-Julia Child</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800"><em>What</em> you focus on matters most. If you’re learning the wrong things, you’re not going to get where you want to go. You’ll also waste a lot of time and energy in the process.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Now, you may be wondering: How do you determine what the fundamentals
        are?</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Apply the 80/20 Rule</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The answer is the result of applying the 80/20 rule: about 80% of the results come from 20% of the efforts.</p> 

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Here’s how you can apply this rule to learning. First, break down the
        topic you’re learning into smaller parts. The broad topic of prealgebra,
        for example, includes exponents, fractions, and decimals.</p>

        <figure class="float-right ml-4 pl-4">

                                                 Less"

        </figure>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If you struggle trying to figure out the parts of a topic, then talk to a few people who've learned it already. You’ll start to see patterns for concepts to learn and ones to avoid, at least initially.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Second, examine each part and ask yourself: Which part will give me the biggest improvement for my efforts?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This is not to advocate for shallow or surface-level learning. Rather, this process champions focusing your time and attention on the things that’ll move the needle the most and get you up and running with the overall concept the quickest. Then, if needed, you can move on to the fine details.</p> 

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Too often people get stuck on the details, which you may need to be an industry expert down the road. But more often than not you don’t need the fine details immediately. It’s far better to spend your time on fundamental concepts first.</p> 

        <p class="text-zinc-800">It’s a point made clear by <a href="https://bit.ly/3bimyZi">Elon Musk</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>“It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic
          tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the
          trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or
          there is nothing for them to hang on to.”</blockquote>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Besides, the details are much more meaningful when there's something to “hang onto.”</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="multiple-streams-of-learning">7. Accelerate your Learning with Multiple Streams of Learning</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Financial gurus tell us to have multiple streams of income. Instead of relying on a single source of income you have many, so the thinking goes.</p> 

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This financial advice is also applicable to learning: actively build a skill or study a field from multiple perspectives—not a single one.</p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400
                   text-center"><em>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I

                     seem to have.</em><br>-Thomas Jefferson</p>
        <p class="text-zinc-800">Most take a siloed approach to learning. They focus on a single form of learning—a course or project, for example, and only that course or project. This approach can be tedious and time-consuming.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Consider a programmer who’s learning computer science. He’s enrolled in an online course that includes lectures and assignments. The learning would stop there for most people. </p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">But not this programmer.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Instead, he applies MSL. The course is one avenue for learning computer science, but not the only one. He spends a lot of time learning the field of computer science in different ways with a variety of resources.</p>

          <li>And, until recently, he led a reading group that discussed
            technical programming books.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">MSL is helping this programmer make connections and solidify
        concepts. It’s also accelerating his rate of learning.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">What he overlooks in one context, he’ll pick up in another. He’s also
        seeing the field of computer science from a variety of perspectives—the
        course instructors, classmates, peers, and authors of technical
        books—rather than a single one. This helps to foster an open mind.</p>


        <p class="text-zinc-800">So the next time you set out to learn something new, create a plan
        that’ll have you attack the topic in multiple ways. MSL is not only an
        efficient and effective way to learn.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">It’s also a lot of <em>fun</em> because there’s variety. There’s something to
        be said for that. Learning something new is often a challenge, but it
        should also be fun and interesting. MSL can help make that happen.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="look-back">8. Look Back</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">A piece of learning advice comes from an unlikely source.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">In his book <em>How to Solve It</em>, mathematician George Pólya outlines a
        four-step problem-solving process. The last step is most relevant to our
        purposes here: “looking back at the completed solution.”</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You look back, according to Pólya, “by re-considering and re-examining
        the result and the path that led to it.” You can solidify your knowledge
        in the process, as Pólya rightly points out.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You can also learn from your solution (or outcome) and understand how to
        improve it. Ultimately, it’s the way to produce quality work.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Pólya writes about looking back through a mathematical perspective. But
        this idea can be widely applied across fields—and it often is.</p>

                     failure without loss of enthusiasm.</em><br>-Winston Churchill</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Consider a chef. A chef constantly looks back during the cooking
        process: assessing their work, critiquing it, learning from others, and
        getting feedback. Why does a chef do such things?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">In order to make the end product better.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">That’s why you’ll see a chef taste the tomato sauce before serving
        it. If it needs more salt or a few more herbs, they’ll add it. If the
        salad looks soggy or the taste of the dressing is off, then they’ll toss
        it out and start again. Why?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">In order to make the end product better.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">A chef doesn’t want to pump out any meal. They want to produce a
        <em>quality</em> one, which is why looking back is part of their cooking process. Doing
        so enhances the quality of their work.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Athletes share the same mentality.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Kobe Bryant, for example, was notorious for watching game films from a
        young age. He studied the greats of basketball so he could <a
                                                                       href="https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2010/columns/story?columnist=macmullan_jackie&page=kobefilmstudy-100604">mimic their moves</a> on the court; he also studied his opponents so he’d know how to
                                                                     handle them come game time. In short, Bryant, as well as chefs, writers,
                                                                     programmers, and mathematicians, among many others, look back in order
                                                                     to move forward.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">And so should you.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">So after you solve a problem, write a program, play a song on the piano,
        or write an article, take time to look back—before you move on to the
        next problem, program, or song. Study your process by applying Pólya’s
        advice: “reconside[r] and re-examin[e] the result and the path that led
        to it.” Doing so will help you better your skills, enhance your knowledge,
        and ultimately produce quality work.</p>

        <h2 class="text-red-700 text-4xl" id="retain-it">Retain It</h2>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="spot-check">1. Spot Check</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You probably recall the pang of angst in your stomach when your teacher
        announced a pop quiz.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Maybe your teacher was in a bad mood and wanted to call you out for not
        completing last night’s homework. Most likely, however, your teacher was
        testing you to see if you were retaining the information being
        taught.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Testing is useful for learning because it involves retrieval. And
        retrieval is behind what psychologists call the “testing effect” (also
        known as “retrieval practice”).</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The idea is that you’ll retain previously learned information better if
        you get tested on it, according to <a
                                               href="https://dictionary.apa.org/testing-effect">American
                                               Psychological Association</a>,
                                             rather than restudying the material "for an equivalent amount of time."
                                             Put another way, you're better off actively testing yourself than
                                             passively reviewing your notes.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">For that reason, you ought to try the Spot Check retrieval practice.
        Randomly check (think: test) your knowledge as you learn new material.
        Similar to a pop quiz, the aim is to see if you can recall recently
        learned material on the spot.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Cruising through a lecture from start to finish—without stopping to
        check your knowledge—often ends with disappointment.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You <em>think</em> you’re making progress because you zoomed through the lecture
        on 1.5x speed. You <em>think</em> you’re adding to your knowledge base because an

        <p class="text-zinc-800">But it’s often an illusion.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You don’t realize it’s an illusion until you’re forced to apply your
        knowledge. This is precisely why the Spot Check technique is useful:
        it’ll show you what you don’t know.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">As you work through the lecture, pause and test your knowledge. For
        example, watch two or three minutes of a lecture or read a page in a
        book test yourself:</p>

        <ul class="text-zinc-800">
          <li>Can you explain the concept covered?</li>
          <li>Can you replicate the program yourself?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If the answer is no, then there’s more work to do <em>before</em> you continue
        along in the book or course. Randomness matters with this tactic because
        you want to catch yourself off-guard, like a pop quiz.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Cranking through material without fully understanding it is like
        building a house on a shaky foundation. The result is unstable. Instead,
        build a solid foundation of knowledge, and use the Spot Check technique
        to help you get there.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="space-it-out">2. Space It Out</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Most of us recall toiling away in the library cramming for an exam
        the next day.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This cramming strategy seems effective, “and it may get you through
        the next day’s midterm,” explain the authors of the book, <em>Make It
          Stick</em>.
        “[B]ut most of the material will be long forgotten by the time you sit
        down for the final.”</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">In other words, spending a big chunk of time learning or practicing a
        skill over a short period of time may help you in the near term. But if
        you’re looking for longer-term retention, you’re better off spacing out
        your practice over a period of time.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Unfortunately, many of us are guilty of taking this cramming habit
        from our school days and applying it to topics we learn about in our
        personal and professional lives. Products, companies, books, and
        platforms promise us to “get rich quick”; speak a foreign language in a
        weekend; or learn to program in 24 hours.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Such promises are enticing. So we fall victim to this cramming model,
        only to find ourselves frustrated at little we’ve retained over time.
        Consequently, we pour more time and effort re-learning previously
        learned concepts.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Trying to learn to program overnight is an example  of massed
        practice. It's when you practice in a single, long session or several
        consecutive sessions.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">A far more effective approach is to space out your practice. Break up
        your practice sessions over a longer period of time, such as a period of
        weeks or months.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Instead of practicing math for five hours on Monday, space your
        practice time out over the work week: one hour each day. Instead of a
        long, killer workout on Saturday, you space out several shorter workouts
        during the course of the week.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Many athletes realize the benefits of spaced practice. Say you’re
        preparing for a marathon. Do you think you’ll be in better
        cardiovascular shape if you run 20-plus miles the weekend before the
        race? Or do you think you’ll be better off running a much smaller amount
        several days each week for several months leading up to the race?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">When it comes to learning, we ought to practice like athletes and
        space it out. A little each day goes a long way. </p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Make It Happen</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This sounds good in theory. But how do you make it a reality?</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The answer is simple: identify your weekly mileage. This is the
        number of hours you can spend learning or skill-building each week.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Think of runners. They often talk about their running mileage: this
        is the number of miles they run each and every week. They’ll talk about
        their 20-mile weeks; 40-mile weeks; 100-mile weeks. That means they run
        20, 40, or 100 miles each and every week.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">To be clear, they’re not setting out to run 20, 40, or 100 miles in a
        <em>single</em> day. Rather, this is the total number of miles they’ll run each
        week. Each day, they’ll chip away at this larger weekly goal.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This is an effective tactic to hold yourself accountable and be
        consistent. That’s why, as learners, we need to take note and create our
        own weekly mileage. </p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Create your Weekly Mileage</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Now, we’re not going to pull this number out of thin air. Spending 14
        hours per week learning, or 2 hours each day, may sound good in the
        moment. But it may not be reasonable for your schedule. That’s why it’s
        important to create a customized number that best fits your needs.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">To do this, you first need to understand what’s on your plate
        <em>before</em> adding anything more to it. Gain this understanding by creating a time
        log: an inventory of the things you do during the day and when you do
        them.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Then, question if you're spending your time on the right things.
        Review each activity on your time log. Then, eliminate or reduce time
        spent toward unproductive or unimportant activities in order to make
        room for more important ones, like learning.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Say you keep a time log for a few days and find that you scroll the
        internet for an hour each night. You reason that you can cut this time
        in half each day, and put the remaining time toward learning. That means
        your weekly mileage is 3.5 hours. And you’ll hit that number by devoting
        30 minutes to learning each day.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">A benefit of creating your weekly mileage is this: you don’t have to
        “find” the time. The time is there; you’ve made room for it. Now it’s
        just a matter of showing up and implementing your learning plan.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900 text-3xl" id="mix-it-up">3. Mix It Up</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">It’s a common trap. We’re driven to learn more and more, but fail to
        take time to review and practice what we’ve already learned.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">That’s a problem.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Soon comes the day when we’re asked to recall previously learned
        concepts—and we can’t, at least not easily. We’ve forgotten what we’ve
        learned last week or last month. We’ve lost our edge. Then, we spend
        even more time re-learning previously learned concepts. It’s a
        time-consuming and frustrating cycle.</p>

        <p class="font-serif my-12 py-8 text-xl border-y border-gray-400
                   text-center"><em>Many of life's failures are people who did not
                     realize how close they were to success when they gave
                     up.</em><br>-Thomas A. Edison</p>


        <p class="text-zinc-800">But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You want to be ready, not rusty, when you need to recall previously
        learned material. And you can by interleaving your learning.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">The Need to Interleave</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Interleaving means to practice two or more topics or skills during a
        practice session. A basketball player, for example, alternates among
        different shots in basketball: free throws, three-point shots, and
        right-handed and left-handed layups. </p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This is in contrast to sequentially working on each type of shot, one
        at a time. For example, shoot 15 free throws, then 15 three-point shots,
        then 15 right-handed layups, and finally left-handed layups.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You can also apply this interleaving technique to intellectual
        pursuits.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Say you’re learning prealgebra, and specifically you’re learning
        about square roots. As you set out to practice today, you mix it up. </p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Begin your practice by solving several fraction, inequality, and
        percent problems—topics you’ve previously learned about. Then, work
        through a few square root problems. Conclude your practice with a
        decimal and ratio problem, which are two other topics you’ve previously
        learned about.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Make It a Reality</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">The key to making interleaving a reality is to decide <em>what</em> topics or
        skills you’ll interleave and <em>how</em> you’ll interleave them in advance of
        your practice session.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">A good way to go about this is to make a weekly plan. In this plan,
        you outline the new topics or skills you want to work on during the week
        ahead. You also identify <em>what</em> topics or skills you’ll interleave during
        your practice sessions. Identify these topics or skills by asking
        yourself:</p>

        <ul class="text-zinc-800">
          <li>What topics or skills am I struggling with?; what needs more
            practice?</li>
          <li>What are topics or skills that I learned several weeks or months
            ago that I should revisit?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Once you know what topics or skills to interleave, then consider
        <em>how</em> you’ll interleave them. Select a few problems, drills, or exercises and
        include this information in your weekly plan. </p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">A programmer, for example, sets out to build a “todo list” app this
        week. But she won’t work on the app exclusively. Rather, she’ll also
        spend time interleaving previously learned topics and skills: solving
        problems in Python and JavaScript and writing SQL queries. She selects
        some problems and exercises to help her stay sharp with Python,
        JavaScript, and SQL.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Importantly, she notes what topics she’ll interleave and how she’ll
        interleave them in her weekly plan. This is useful to do for
        accountability reasons. So on Monday when she sets out to practice, it’s
        never a question of <em>what</em> to work on or <em>if</em> she wants to work on it;
        rather, she just has to implement the plan: work through a
        Python-related problem and write several SQL queries before she turns
        her attention to the app.</p>

        <h4 class="text-zinc-900">Life Isn’t Linear</h4>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Sure, interleaving your practice takes a bit of planning at the
        outset. But the benefits are worth it.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">First, you’ll stay sharp with previously learned material as you
        learn new things. Plus, in our experience, it’s a great way to pick up
        on the details as you revisit previously learned content or skills.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">This makes sense because you know more now than you did three weeks
        ago. You’ll also see things differently, and probably better, than you
        did before when you set out to learn the topic initially. </p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Second, interleaving can keep you prepared for the unexpected. Rarely
        does life come at you predictably in sequential order. Rather, you have
        to be ready for anything. Interleaving can help prepare yourself for
        this very real-world scenario.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Besides, it’s better to have a variety of tools in your toolbox, and
        to pick the best tool to do the job. A way to have a reliable set of
        tools is to stay sharp with previously learned material and skills by
        interleaving.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">You’ve already sunk a lot of time and effort into learning something.
        Staying sharp with previously learned material is a small investment in
        your future self. Not only will you feel prepared when the day comes to
        recall previously learned concepts. But you’ll also be happy that you
        don’t have to re-learn a topic all over again.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900">1. Who should use this guide?</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">We imagine you’re a working professional, student, athlete, or
        lifelong learner of any age. The commonality is this: you’re looking for
        practical ways to learn a topic efficiently and effectively.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900">2. What about reading <em>X</em> book on learning, instead of using the
          tactics you provide?</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Reading is a fantastic way to build a storehouse of knowledge, and we
        highly recommend reading on a variety of topics—including learning.
        Contextual information is useful, as is keeping abreast with current
        research.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">But what’s needed are concrete and practical ways for
        anyone to learn more efficiently and effectively from the learner’s
        perspective.  This was the motivation behind this guide. In short, it’s
        important to have <em>both</em> theory and practicality. We hope this guide
        provides the latter.</p>

        <h3 class="text-zinc-900">3. How strict is the sequence of the learning tactics?</h3>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">If you’re learning something new, we highly recommend that you begin
        learning a topic by applying the tactic: Get the Big Picture.</p>

        <p class="text-zinc-800">Then, it’s up to you. We realize that different topics and learning
        styles influence the tactics that’ll be most relevant to you. So we aim
        to provide options, and leave it to you to decide which option is best
        based on your needs.</p>
