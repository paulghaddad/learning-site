        <p>If you’re learning a new topic, you owe it to yourself to have an efficient and effective learning process.
          Thankfully, you can teach yourself how to learn without investing a lot of time or wasting a lot of energy
          identifying what learning tactics work and which ones don’t.</p>

        <p>You don’t need another article that summarizes recent research. You do need a practical guide that simplifies
          the
          learning process. You want answers to these questions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What learning tactics should I use, and how do I apply them?</li>
          <li>How do I retain everything I’ve learned?</li>
          <li>Where can I learn more about the learning process?</li>
        </ul>

        This guide is our attempt to answer these questions.

        <p>Choose a learning tactic below and apply it to the topic you’re learning about. There are many tactics
          offered—for
          both learning and retaining information—to accommodate a variety of learning styles.</p>

        <p>Try a few and find the ones that work for you. Then, revisit this list as you learn new topics. The tactics you
          need may vary by the topic you’re learning.</p>

        <h2>Make It Efficient</h2>


        <h3>1. Get the Big Picture</h3>

        <p>You want to put together a 1,000-word puzzle. But, before you begin, you prop up the puzzle box on the table
        and
        take a good look at it, since it contains an image of what the puzzle looks like when complete. You mentally
        note
        its major features: a bridge, several skyscrapers, a river, and a sky at sunset.</p>

        <p>You’ve just made solving the puzzle easier because you have the big picture: a high-level view of your task
        and
        what to focus on. Instead of dealing with 1,000 random pieces, your mind is primed to think about the major
        components that you’ll have to put together.</p>

        <p>When you get the big picture, you move from disorder to order; complex to simple; difficult to manageable. As
        a
        result, you’ll work with purpose because you know what to focus on.</p>

        <p>Learning a new topic is no different.</p>

        <p>Typically, when learning a new topic people dive into the details—all of the details—from the start. They
        sink a
        ton of time and effort learning everything only to realize after the fact that they only needed a fraction of
        what
        they learned.</p>

        <p>Enter the big picture. It’s when you get a general understanding of a topic—a lay of the land—by identifying
        core
        concepts before you try to learn the material. In the process, you identify what topics matter most and where
        you
        ought to focus your time and attention. It’s a simple way to make learning something new much more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>It’s not to say that the details don’t matter. They do. But—and this is the key point—you don’t need to know
        everything right now. Getting the big picture is like a filter: it’ll help you distinguish the nice to know
        from the
        have to know.</p>

        <p>Here are some ways you can get the big picture:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Watch a lecture on fast speed. Undoubtedly, you’ll miss most of the details. That’s fine, because your aim
            is to
            identify the core concepts discussed. Then, decide whether or not they’re relevant to the overall subject
            that
            you’re trying to learn. Oftentimes, an instructor will spend a lot of time discussing important concepts or
            they’ll repeat important concepts multiple times. These may be components to add to the big picture of
            whatever
            you’re learning about.</li>
          <li>Skim chapter headers. The headings of a chapter or article often give away a lot of information. If you
            find a
            relevant header, skim the passage under that header.</li>
          <li>Talk to someone who already knows the material. Identify one to three people who’ve already learned the
            material
            you’re trying to learn. Contact them, and ask if they’d be willing to talk to you about their learning
            journey.
            Ask which concepts they focused on; how they determined their learning sequence; and what they’d do
            differently if
            they were to start over again. You’ll start to see patterns after you talk to a few people. Use this
            information
            to inform your own learning journey.</li>
          <li>Read the chapter summary. The end of a book chapter often contains a section that summarizes key points.
            Read
            this first to understand the main ideas that are discussed. If an idea seems important, then skim the
            relevant
            section.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Getting the big picture will help you train your brain to hone in on the topics that matter most, and filter
        out
        the lesser ones. It'll also help you focus on the right things at the right time, while realizing that you can
        always circle back in the future to some nuance when you need it.</p>

        <h2>Learn It</h2>

        <h3>1. Cross-Train</h3>

        <p>Many athletes cross-train by regularly incorporating a related skill or task into their workout routine. A swimmer completes a run or two each week; a runner completes one or more bike workouts each week.</p>

        <p>By cross-training, athletes push their cardiovascular fitness in a different way. This adds to their overall fitness. It also keeps things fresh and prevents burnout. In short, cross-training complements the skill you’re building.</p>

        <p>And it’s not just for athletes.</p>

        <p>Cross-training is useful for intellectual pursuits as well. Cross-train your brain to improve your mental fitness by regularly incorporating a related skill or task in your learning routine.</p>

        <p>The cross-training methods you incorporate vary from field to field. A programmer, for example, can cross-train by
        solving math problems or working through a logic course. These are useful activities because both involve logical
        thinking, and so does programming. By cross-training, a programmer gets practice thinking logically in a different
        context. That’s a key point.</p>

        <p>Changing contexts forces you to think differently, use a variety of tactics, and see things from another perspective. It also forces you outside of your comfort zone, which is where you’ll learn and grow the most.</p>

        <p>Once you identify a cross-training method, apply it at least one time each week. Consistency is critical to reap the best results.</p>

        <h3>2. Study Experts</h3>

        <p>“First you imitate, then you innovate,” Miles Davis once said. Athletes, musicians, writers, and artists, among many others, have put this idea into action—and for good reason. It works.</p>

        <p>If you’re trying to learn a new skill, then you ought to give it a try. Do so by studying the work of others using a learning tactic Benjamin Franklin applied to become a better writer. Below is a summary of Franklin’s process, as explained in his autobiography.</p>

        <p>Franklin would choose an article from the Spectator—a publication he admired and wanted to emulate—and study articles from it. He’d study an article by making hints of the “sentiment” in each sentence. After a few days passed, Franklin used the hints to replicate the article.</p>

        <p>This wasn’t a process in memorization; he wasn’t trying to memorize the article word for word. Rather, he aimed to capture the same expression and completeness as the original—using his own words.</p>

        <p>Franklin concluded the process by comparing his version of the article to the one he studied: he identified his mistakes and corrected them.</p>

        <p>This tactic can be molded to fit nearly any skill you’re working on. The recipe is nearly the same:</p>

        <h4>1. Find someone in your field who does the thing you want to do and does it well.</h2>

        <p>This should be someone whose skills you admire and want to emulate. Ideally, this is someone who’s better than you. Think of the experts in your field for ideas. Even someone who’s a step or two ahead of you can work for this practice.</p>

        <h4>2. Study this person’s skill by making hints.</h4>

        <p>Perhaps, like Franklin, you want to become a better writer. You’ve identified an article to study (step 1). Now
        you’re going to study the article by making hints.</p>

        <p>Aim to explain when you work through this hint-making process. Go beyond surface level and fully understand what’s happening and why.</p>

        <p>Explaining is different than describing.</p>

        <p>To describe Claude Monet’s painting, Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare, you may say a train billows smoke as it enters a train station. By contrast, if you explain this painting, you would go beyond surface level and speculate why Monet painted a train; why did he use quick brushstrokes of paint?; why did he include the glass-and-iron train shed?</p>

        <p>When you explain a concept, you’ll find that the learning process is far more meaningful. Plus, this is a great way to test your knowledge. If you can’t wrap a simple explanation around a concept or step, then that’s a sign you have some learning to do. Pause and learn it.</p>

        <p>It’s better to find out about a trouble spot now—and do something about it—than to let it fester. It’s likely that you’ll run into the same concept or a related one in a few weeks or months. In short, your future self will appreciate the time you spend now learning what’s new or unfamiliar to you.</p>

        <h4>3. Replicate.</h4>

        <p>Let some time pass, as Franklin did, then use the hints you created as a guide and replicate the skill that you studied. For example, re-write the article or re-solve the problem.</p>

        <h4>4. Study your outcome.</h4>

        <p>Compare your outcome—the thing you just replicated—to the one you studied. As you compare, identify your mistakes and make the changes.</p>

        <p>Don’t bypass this step.</p>

        <p>It’s an important one to take in order to build a critical skill: self-assessment. Train your mind and eye to identify your mistakes and correct them.</p>

        <p>Apply this learning tactic as often as possible, especially if you’re just starting out. It’s time well-spent. That’s because you’ll hit several core competencies of skill-building:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Understand the details and nuances of how an expert in your field works.</li>
          <li>Practice doing the thing you want to improve—at the level you aim to be at.</li>
          <li>Get practice teaching yourself.</li>
          <li>Develop your ability to self-assess your own work.</li>
          <li>Build good habits from the start.</li>
          <li>See patterns in your craft.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Teach It</h3>

        <p>“If you want to master something,” Yogi Bhajan once said, “teach it.” Whether you aim to master a topic or want to get better at it, then you ought to heed Bhajan’s advice. Fortunately, there are simple ways to go about it.</p>

        <p>First, teach others. Sure, you could teach a class or author a course. But there are less time intensive ways to go about it.</p>

        <p>One way is to give a short speech or presentation at a Meetup group or Toastmasters club. Many of these organizations are virtual, which makes teaching others even more convenient. Or create a few YouTube videos.</p>

        <p>Writing is another means of teaching to consider. Submit an article or blog post to one of the many publications that take submissions.</p>

        <p>And if you think you don’t have anything to say or write about because you’re new to the field, think again. Whether you've been working on your skill for months or years, you’ve got something to offer and your field could benefit from a range of voices.</p>

        <p>Despite the medium, teaching others will force you to solidify your ideas and test your understanding of a topic. Besides, when you set out to help others by teaching, you also help yourself.</p>

        <p>Second, teach yourself.</p>

        <p>Once you have a concrete outcome—a painting, an article, a crafted piece of wood—walk yourself through the process of how you got there. You can also apply this technique to performance-related skills, like shooting free throws. Record yourself shooting; then, watch yourself and detail the process along the way.</p>

        <p>In either case, explain—don’t describe—what you did and why you did it.</p>

        <p>Swirls and strokes of color—black, white, and beige—fill a large horizontal canvas. This statement describes Jackson Pollock’s painting, Autumn Rhythm (Number 30). It’s very basic. It’s surface level. It doesn’t tell you a whole lot.</p>

        <p>Don’t describe when you teach yourself.</p>

        <p>Instead, aim to explain. If you explain this artwork, you would pull back the covers and dig into the deeper meaning of this piece. You may explain answers to these questions: why did Pollock use swirls, strokes, and drops of paint; what do they mean or represent?; how did Pollock work to achieve a painting like this (i.e., why doesn’t the paint drip downwards?; how is it contained in the center of the canvas?).</p>

        <p>You dig deeper—moving beyond surface level—when you explain. That’s the goal.</p>

        <p>Teaching yourself is a great way to test your knowledge, solidify your understanding, find areas of improvement, and clarify your thinking.</p>

        <h3>4. Apply First, Study Second</h3>

        <p>One of the best ways to learn—and actually retain your knowledge—is to use an approach we call Apply First, Study Second.</p>

        <p>The idea is to actively apply your existing knowledge first. Attempt the problem; attempt the article; attempt the design. Then, turn to passive modes of learning, such as referencing books or watching tutorials, when you get stuck.</p>

        <p>Say you want to become a better programmer. Instead of watching hours of online tutorials, you do something different: you pick a practice project and attempt the project yourself first.</p>

        <p>Then, when you get stuck, turn to passive modes of learning like watching tutorials. But—and this is the important point—instead of cycling through a bunch of tutorials, you’ll focus on the one that’ll help you push through the roadblock. Simply put, you’ll reference the resource with purpose. Once you have the information that you need, it’s back to the project at hand.</p>

        <p>Apply First, Study Second stresses the importance of the attempt.</p>

        <p>You don’t need to draw the perfect picture or create an award-winning design. Attempt the picture; attempt the design. There’s value in the attempt.</p>

        <p>Applying your existing knowledge first draws awareness to the roadblock—the thing you don’t know or need to get better at. You’ll think to yourself: How do I do X?</p>

        <p>Now that you’re aware of the roadblock, you know where to focus your time and attention. Instead of trying to learn everything about cooking, for instance, or re-learning concepts you already know, zone in on the one thing that’s going to get you past your roadblock. That way, you can move along in the cooking process.</p>

        <p>Once you have what you need, then apply it. If you get stuck again, follow the same iterative process: determine the roadblock; identify a resource that’ll help you get past it; apply your newfound knowledge.</p>

        <p>This approach runs counter to how most of us got through school. It also runs counter to how many popular learning platforms operate. That’s because passive modes of learning are often easier to create for the masses than active ones.</p>

        <p>It’s far easier to watch a math wiz solve problems than to solve them yourself. But easier isn’t better when it comes to learning.</p>

        <p>“We’re easily seduced into believing that learning is better when it’s easier,” explain the authors of the book Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning, “but the research shows the opposite: when the mind has to work, learning sticks better.”</p>

        <p>If you’re looking for an efficient and effective way to learn a topic or build a skill, you ought to give this approach a try.</p>

        <h3>5. Build Mental Models</h3>

        <p>You use mental models in daily life to help you think, decide, and understand the world around you.</p> 

        <p>They’re also useful when learning new things.</p>

        <p>Organize your learning into mental models: patterns or frameworks that help explain something in the real world.
        Mental models can help make the abstract concrete; and the complex simple, or at least a bit easier to think about.
        </p>

        <p>One of the best ways to build mental models comes from a familiar, but underutilized, learning tactic: get feedback
        from others.</p>

        <p>You may be thinking: That’s so obvious!</p>

        <p>Well, getting feedback may seem obvious. But few people take advantage of this learning opportunity—and it is an
        opportunity. After all, most of us are surrounded by bright people who are often more than willing to help. We just
        need to simply ask for it.</p>

        <p>Those who seek feedback usually do so in order to draw awareness to their blindspots. What you may overlook, someone
        else can point out. Admittedly, this is an obvious reason to get feedback.</p>

        <p>But what’s far less talked about are the mental models you can build.</p>

        <p>Many times when a person provides feedback they also share their mental models: how they think about a particular
        topic or concept. In doing so, they may draw a diagram to illustrate their thinking; or they may verbally walk you
        through their thought process. Oftentimes, this is all you need to wrap your mind around a challenging topic.</p>

        <p>If the person doesn’t proactively share their mental models, then ask: How did you know to think about X in this way?
        This will prompt them to take a step back and clearly articulate their thinking.</p>

        <p>Learning something new—especially complex and abstract concepts—can be hard and time-consuming. Lighten your load by
        regularly asking for feedback. Surely, you’ll get feedback in the traditional sense and often a lot more. Just ask.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Focus on the Fundamentals</h3>

        <p>There’s an essential question to ask when you set out to learn a new topic or build a new skill: What to focus on first?</p>

        <p>The answer is simple: the fundamentals. They’re the building blocks of whatever you’re learning about. If you bypass
        the fundamentals, you bypass a solid foundation of knowledge.</p>

        <p>What you focus on matters most. If you’re learning the wrong things, you’re not going to get where you want to go. You’ll also waste a lot of time and energy in the process.</p>

        <p>The next question is this: How do you determine what the fundamentals are?</p>

        <p>The answer is the result of applying the 80/20 rule: about 80% of the results come from 20% of the efforts.</p> 

        <p>Here’s how you can apply this rule to learning. First, break down the topic you’re learning into smaller parts. The broad topic of prealgebra, for example, include exponents, fractions, and decimals.</p> 

        <p>If you struggle trying to figure out the parts of a topic, then talk to a few people who've learned it already. You’ll start to see patterns for concepts to learn and ones to avoid, at least initially.</p>

        <p>Second, examine each part and ask yourself: Which part will give me the biggest improvement for my efforts?</p>

        <p>This is not to advocate for shallow or surface-level learning. Rather, this process champions focusing your time and attention on the things that’ll move the needle the most and get you up and running with the overall concept the quickest. Then, if needed, you can move on to the fine details.</p> 

        <p>Too often people get stuck on the details, which you may need to be an industry expert down the road. But more often than not you don’t need the fine details immediately. It’s far better to spend your time on fundamental concepts first.</p> 

        <p>It’s a point made clear by Elon Musk:</p>

        <p>“It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”</p>

        <p>Besides, the details are much more meaningful when there's something to “hang onto.”</p>

        <h3>7. Accelerate your Learning with Multiple Streams of Learning</h3>

        <p>Financial gurus tell us to have multiple streams of income. Instead of relying on a single source of income you have many, so the thinking goes.</p> 

        <p>This financial advice is also applicable to learning: actively build a skill or study a field from multiple perspectives—not a single one.</p>

        <p>Most take a siloed approach to learning. They focus on a single form of learning—a course or project, for example, and only that course or project. This approach can be tedious and time-consuming.</p>

        <p>Multiple Streams of Learning (MSL) is different. It champions attacking a topic from multiple perspectives. </p>

        <p>Consider a programmer who’s learning computer science. He’s enrolled in an online course that includes lectures and assignments. The learning would stop there for most people. </p>

        <p>But not this programmer. </p>

        <p>Instead, he applies MSL. The course is one avenue for learning computer science, but not the only one. He spends a lot of time learning the field of computer science in different ways with a variety of resources.</p>

        <h3>8. Look Back</h3>

        <p>A piece of learning advice comes from an unlikely source.</p>

        <p>In his book How to Solve It, mathematician George Pólya outlines a
        four-step problem-solving process. The last step is most relevant to our
        purposes here: “looking back at the completed solution.”</p>

        <p>You look back, according to Pólya, “by re-considering and re-examining
        the result and the path that led to it.” You can solidify your knowledge
        in the process, as Pólya rightly points out.</p>

        <p>You can also learn from your solution (or outcome) and understand how to
        improve it. Ultimately, it’s the way to produce quality work.</p>

        <p>Pólya writes about looking back through a mathematical perspective. But
        this idea can be widely applied across fields—and it often is.</p>

        <p>Consider a chef. A chef constantly looks back during the cooking
        process: assessing their work, critiquing it, learning from others, and
        getting feedback. Why does a chef do such things?</p>

        <p>In order to make the end product better.</p>

        <p>That’s why you’ll see a chef taste the tomato sauce before serving it.
        If it needs more salt or a few more herbs, they’ll add them. If the
        salad looks soggy or the taste of the dressing is off, then they’ll toss
        it out and start again. Why?</p>

        <p>In order to make the end product better.</p>

        <p>A chef doesn’t want to pump out any meal. They want to produce a quality
        one, which is why looking back is part of their cooking process. Doing
        so enhances the quality of their work.</p>

        <p>Athletes share the same mentality.</p>

        <p>Kobe Bryant, for example, was notorious for watching game films from a
        young age. He studied the greats of basketball so he could mimic their
        moves on the court; he also studied his opponents so he’d know how to
        handle them come game time. In short, Bryant, as well as chefs, writers,
        programmers, and mathematicians, among many others, look back in order
        to move forward.</p>

        <p>And so should you.</p>

        <p>So after you solve a problem, write a program, play a song on the piano,
        or write an article, take time to look back—before you move on to the
        next problem, program, or song. Study your process by applying Pólya’s
        advice: reconsider and re-examine the result and the path that led to
        it. Doing so will help you better your skills, enhance your knowledge,
        and ultimately produce quality work.</p>

        <h2>Retain It</h2>

        <h3>Spot Check</h3>

        <p>You probably recall the pang of angst in your stomach when your teacher
        announced a pop quiz.</p>

        <p>Maybe your teacher was in a bad mood and wanted to call you out for not
        completing last night’s homework. Most likely, however, your teacher was
        testing you to see if you were retaining the information being
        taught.</p>

        <p>Testing is useful for learning because it involves retrieval. And
        retrieval is behind what psychologists call the “testing effect” (also
        known as “retrieval practice”).</p>

        <p>The idea is that you’ll retain previously learned information better if
        you get tested on it, according to American Psychological Association,
        rather than restudying the material "for an equivalent amount of time."
        Put another way, you're better off actively testing yourself than
        passively reviewing your notes.</p>

        <p>For that reason, you ought to try the Spot Check retrieval practice.
        Randomly check (think: test) your knowledge as you learn new material.
        Similar to a pop quiz, the aim is to see if you can recall recently
        learned material on the spot.</p>

        <p>Cruising through a lecture from start to finish—without stopping to
        check your knowledge—often ends with disappointment.</p>

        <p>You think you’re making progress because you zoomed through the lecture
        on 1.5x speed. You think you’re adding to your knowledge base because an
        expert made the process look so easy. You think you’ve got it.</p>

        <p>But it’s often an illusion.</p>

        <p>You don’t realize it’s an illusion until you’re forced to apply your
        knowledge. This is precisely why the Spot Check technique is useful:
        it’ll show you what you don’t know.</p>

        <p>As you work through the lecture, pause and test your knowledge. For
        example, watch two or three minutes of a lecture or read a page in a
        book test yourself:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Can you explain the concept covered?</li>
          <li>Can you replicate the program yourself?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the answer is no, then there’s more work to do before you continue
        along in the book or course. Randomness matters with this tactic because
        you want to catch yourself off-guard, like a pop quiz.</p>

        <p>Cranking through material without fully understanding it is like
        building a house on a shaky foundation. The result is unstable. Instead,
        build a solid foundation of knowledge, and use the Spot Check technique
        to help you get there.</p>

        <h3>2. Stay Sharp</h3>

        <p>It’s a common trap. We’re driven to learn more and more, but fail to
        take time to review and practice what we’ve already learned.</p>

        <p>That’s a problem.</p>

        <p>Soon comes the day when we’re asked to recall previously learned
        concepts—and we can’t, at least not easily. We’ve forgotten what we’ve
        learned last week or last month. We’ve lost our edge. Then, we spend
        even more time re-learning previously learned concepts. It’s a
        time-consuming and frustrating cycle.</p>

        <p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

        <p>You want to be ready, not rusty, when you need to recall previously
        learned material. And you can by using Anki, a flashcard program.</p>

        <p>Anki is useful because it uses spaced repetition: a learning technique
        where you repeatedly review a topic over time. The idea is to retrieve
        information over time at different intervals; challenging cards are
        shown more frequently than easier one.</p>

        <p>You may, for example, see a new flashcard today. Then, you may see the
        card again in a day, a week, ten days, a few months, and so on. You
        influence how quickly you see a card based on given time periods, which
        can vary.</p>

        <p>It’s not just using a flashcard program, like Anki, that matters. But
        it’s also how you use it. We recommend that you interleave the topics
        you’re learning about.</p>

        <p>Rather than focusing on one thing and then the next, mix it up. Practice
        "several related skills together," explains Scientific American. "A
        pianist alternates practice between scales, chords, and arpeggios, while
        a tennis player alternates practice between forehands, backhands, and
        volleys."</p>

        <p>Interleave with Anki by creating multiple flashcard decks: one deck for
        each topic. An art history student could create a Renaissance art
        flashcard deck and an Impressionist art flashcard deck, and so on. Then,
        they’d study a deck that’s different from what they’re currently
        learning about. So a student may study their Impressionist art deck as
        they learn about pop art.</p>

        <p>You’ve already sunk a lot of time and effort into learning something.
        Using a flashcard program like Anki is a small investment in your future
        self. Not only will you feel prepared when the day comes to recall
        previously learned material. But you’ll also be happy that you don’t
        have to re-learn a topic all over again.</p>
